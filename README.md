  * Parse a meta data file and store the operating system operations in an appropriate data structure
  * Display operations to the screen or a log file
  * Implement various OS scheduling strategies
  * Utilize threads for I/O and CPU operations
  * Appropriately handle race conditions to create a deterministic OS Simulator
